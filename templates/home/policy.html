			Statement of General Principles Regarding Data Access
			<ol class="Numbering">
				<li class="Body">
					Overall Policy Goal
					<p>This policy provides information and guidelines for individuals wishing to request access to data stored within the Australian Human Variome Database (“the Database”) for diagnostic, clinical or research use. The Human Variome Project Australian Node (“the Node”) is committed to providing diagnostic, clinical and research investigators the opportunity to access data for purposes that are consistent with the missions of both the Node and the International Human Variome Project.</p>
				</li>
				<p><li class="Body">The following policy is drafted to provide reasonable access to data while allowing the Node to meet its obligation of ensuring the data is used in a legal and ethically compliant manner.</li></p>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="Heading">
			Purpose of the Human Variome Project Australian Node
			<ol class="Numbering">
				<li class="Body">The Human Variome Project Australian Node is a repository of genetic test results and interpretations as reported by diagnostic laboratories within Australia.</li>
				<p><li class="Body">Access to the data is provided through the Australian Node Portal to diagnostic laboratory workers and clinicians for direct diagnostic/clinical use: determining the classification and consequences of a variant discovered in the genetic sequence of an individual patient.</li></p>
				<p><li class="Body">Access to the data for research use is provided through the BioGrid system (<a href="http://www.biogrid.org.au">http://www.biogrid.org.au</a>) where it can be linked in a de-identified manner with records from other data sources accessible by BioGrid.</li></p>
			</ol>

		<li class="Heading">
			Management Overview
			<ol class="Numbering">
				<li class="Body">The Human Variome Project Australian Node is a project maintained by the Department of Pathology of the University of Melbourne.</li>
				<p><li class="Body">The management structure of the Human Variome Project Australian Node is outlined in full on the Node website (<a href="http://www.hvpaustralia.org.au/">http://www.hvpaustralia.org.au/</a>).
					<ol class="Numbering">
						<li class="Body">The day-to-day operations are of the Node are managed by the Project Director, advised by the Management Advisory Committee.</li>
						<p><li class="Body">The views of the users of the Node are communicated to the Project Director by the Users Committee, a representative body of the end users of data held by the Node.</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">The Australian Node Access Committee manages and reviews access requests for the data within the Database.</li><p>

		<li class="Heading">
			Identified User and Use Types
			<ol class="Numbering">
				<li class="Body">In this document, Users are defined as those individuals who have been granted access to the Database either through the Portal for clinical and diagnostic use, or through the BioGrid service for research use.</li>
				<p><li class="SubHeading">Diagnostic/Clinical Use
					<ol class="Numbering">
						<li class="Body">As stated in Paragraph 2.2 above, access to the Database for direct diagnostic or clinical use is possible through the Australian Node Portal.</li>
						<p><li class="Body">The Australian Node Portal has three user types: Registered, Laboratory Admin and Node Admin users. Guest access to the Portal (i.e. access without registration) is not possible.</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">Members of the Registered Users category can be:
							<ol class="Numbering">
								<li class="Body">Individuals who are employees of laboratories located in Australia that are recognised by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and/or the National Association of Testing Authorities as conducting genetic testing;</li>
								<p><li class="Body">Individual medical practitioners who are registered with the Medical Board of Australia who can demonstrate a need to access information stored within the Database in order to manage one or more of their current patients; or</li></p>
								<p><li class="Body">Individuals who have received Board certification or higher from the Human Genetics Society of Australia in the area of genetic counselling.</li></p>
							</ol>
						</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">Members of the Laboratory Admin category are those individuals who satisfy the requirements of Paragraph 4.4.1 and who have been appointed by their laboratory to manage the list of Registered Users for that laboratory.</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">Members of the Node Admin category are restricted to members of staff of the Human Variome Project Australian Node.</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">All applications for registration are reviewed and approved by the Australian Node Access Committee.</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">Other individuals with a demonstrable need for access for diagnostic/clinical use may apply to the Australian Node Access Committee for consideration.</li></p>
					</ol>
				</li></p>
				<p><li class="SubHeading">Research Use
					<ol class="Numbering">
						<li class="Body">Access to the data contained in the Database for use in research projects is possible via the BioGrid service (<a href="http://www.biogrid.org.au">http://www.biogrid.org.au</a>), subject to the terms and conditions imposed by BioGrid and a full scientific and ethical review of the proposed research.</li>
						<p><li class="Body">As per the BioGrid Data Access Process, requests for access to the Database for research use will be referred to the Data Access Committee who will engage data submitters in the process of determining access.</li></p>
						<p><li class="Body">All publications containing data or analyses consisting of, or derived from, information obtained from the Database must provide acknowledgement of the source of that information.</li></p>
